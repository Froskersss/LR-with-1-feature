# LR-with-1-feature
here is my implementation of linear regression of 1 feature only. No scikit was used all of it has been made from scratch.

In my file where I try to use OLS to figure out the linear regression. People will find it weird that I added the 3 column values into 1 single value. I did this cause i haven't figured out how to do linear regression using  multiple features and plan to implement that from scratch as well in the future.
If you have any suggestions/criticisms for the code please contaact me. I would love to receive some advice.
Have a good day ahead.
